       <p class="par">A <u><b><span class="tiger"></span></b></u> was making fun of the <u><b><span class="lion"></span></b></u> one day for being so slow.</p>
       <p class="par"> "Do you ever get anywhere?"he asked with a mocking laugh. </p>
       <p class="par">"<u><b><span class="yes"></span></b></u>", replied the <u><b><span class="lion"></span></b></u> "but I get there <u><b><span class="quick"></span></b></u> than you think. I'll run you a race prove it."</p>
       <p class="par">The <u><b><span class="tiger"></span></b></u> was much <u><b><span class="alarm"></span></b></u> at the idea of running a race with the <u><b><span class="lion"></span></b></u>. but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the <u><b><span class="dog"></span></b></u>. who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance yelled, "<u><b><span class="exam"></span></b></u>".</p>
       <p class="par">The <u><b><span class="tiger"></span></b></u> was soon far out of sight,and to make the <u><b><span class="lion"></span></b></u> feel very deeply how rediculous it was for him to try a race with a <u><b><span class="tiger"></span></b></u>. he went off the course to practice <u><b><span class="running"></span></b></u> for <u><b><span class="two"></span></b></u> hours until the <u><b><span class="lion"></span></b></u> should catch up.</p>
       <p class="par">The <u><b><span class="lion"></span></b></u> meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily. and, after a time, passed the place where the <u><b><span class="tiger"></span></b></u> was <u><b><span class="running"></span></b></u> .The <u><b><span class="tiger"></span></b></u> was so caught up in <u><b><span class="running"></span></b></u>; and when at last he did stop, the <u><b><span class="lion"></span></b></u> was near the goal.The <u><b><span class="tiger"></span></b></u> now ran his swiftesy, but he could not overtake the <u><b><span class="lion"></span></b></u> in time.</p>
